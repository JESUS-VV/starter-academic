abstract = {Background: Athletes tend to have better visuomotor performance than do sedentary individuals. However, several basic visual-function and perceptual parameters remain unexplored to date. In this study, we investigate whether differences exist in visual function, performance, and processing between basketball players and individuals without a sport-involvement background. Methods: A total of 33 healthy men with no visual impairment or pathology were divided into 2 groups based on their involvement in sport (semi-professional basketball players and sedentary individuals). We tested their baseline heart rate variability (HRV) in the resting position apart from subjective questionnaires to determine their physical fitness level, and checked their visual function, performance, and processing through an extended battery of optometric tests. Results: The 2 groups differed in resting HRV parameters (p {\textless}. 0.001), which confirms their dissimilarities in regular time practicing sports per week. The basketball players showed a closer breakpoint and recovery near point of convergence, higher fusional-vergence rate, better discriminability halos, and eye-hand coordination (all p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: These results evidence that athletes, basketball players in this case, exhibit better performance in several visual abilities in comparison with a group of individuals without sporting backgrounds, which suggests an improvement due to the systematic involvement of those skills during basketball practice.},

abstract = {Purpose Fitness level modulates the physiological responses to exercise for a variety of indices. While intense bouts of exercise have been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity (Tosm), it is not known if fitness level can affect the Tosm response to acute exercise. This study aims to compare the effect of a maximal incremental test on Tosm between trained and untrained military helicopter pilots. Methods Nineteen military helicopter pilots (ten trained and nine untrained) performed a maximal incremental test on a treadmill. A tear sample was collected before and after physical effort to determine the exercise-induced changes on Tosm. Results The Bayesian statistical analysis demonstrated that Tosm significantly increased from 303.72 ± 6.76 to 310.56 ± 8.80 mmol/L after performance of a maximal incremental test. However, while the untrained group showed an acute Tosm rise (12.33 mmol/L of increment), the trained group experienced a stable Tosm physical effort (1.45 mmol/L). There was a significant positive linear association between fat indices and Tosm changes (correlation coefficients [r] range: 0.77–0.89), whereas the Tosm changes displayed a negative relationship with the cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2 max; r = −0.75) and performance parameters (r = −0.75 for velocity, and r = −0.67 for time to exhaustion). Conclusions The findings from this study provide evidence that fitness level is a major determinant of Tosm response to maximal incremental physical effort, showing a fairly linear association with several indices related to fitness level. High fitness level seems to be beneficial to avoid Tosm changes as consequence of intense exercise.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated the acute effect of maximal cycling sprint against difference resistances on intraocular pressure (IOP) depending on participants' fitness level. Methods: In total, 26 physically active collegiate men performed 5 maximal cycling sprints against different resistances in a randomized order, and IOP was measured immediately before and after each sprint. Participants were divided in 2 subgroups (low fit and high fit) according to their maximum power output relative to body weight to assess the influence of fitness level. Two identical testing sessions were performed to assess the repeatability of IOP values. Results: We found that IOP decreases with the lightest resistance (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas IOP increases with heavier resistances (P {\textless} 0.01), and it showed a positive linear tendency (r = 0.99). Our results suggest that participants' fitness level seems to influence IOP responses, with a more stable response in the high-fit group. A strong intersession repeatability of IOP values was observed (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.82 to 0.98; coefficients of variations range, 1.76{\%} to 6.23{\%}). Conclusions: We conclude that (1) IOP is sensitive to cycling resistance in all-out sprints, with a lowering effect on the lightest resistance and an increasing effect with medium and heavy resistances, (2) high fitness level is beneficial to avoid IOP fluctuations during sprints, and (3) these changes are comparable when measured on 2 different days under the same experimental conditions. A progressive involvement in physical activity may be desirable to avoid IOP peaks during highly demanding physical effort. Future studies are needed to clarify the consequences of exercise in glaucoma patients.},

abstract = {Appropriate visual function is paramount to ensuring adequate driving performance and road safety. Here, we examined the influence of sudden artificially-impaired binocular vision on driving performance using a car simulator. Twenty-four young drivers (mean age 22.42±3.19years) drove under three different visual conditions (natural driving, monocular blur, and monocular occlusion) through three different traffic environments with low, medium, and high levels of complexity (highway, rural, and city, respectively). We assessed their driving performance, perceived level of task complexity, and subjectively-experienced road safety. Furthermore, as a manipulation check, we also evaluated the drivers' cardiac vagal responses, as a well-known index of task complexity. The sudden deterioration of binocular vision caused unsafe driving behaviours (distance out of the road and maximum breaking intensity) in the most complex traffic environments. Specific self-regulatory strategies (i.e. increased cardiac vagal responses) and subjective responses corroborated these results. Practitioner summary: This study provides evidence that the sudden deterioration of binocular vision has a detrimental effect on simulated driving performance. Our analysis of cardiovascular functioning shows that drivers adopt self-regulatory strategies when their binocular vision functioning is compromised.

This study investigates the dynamics of ocular accommodation and pupil size in a population of children with ADHD (6–14 years old) and assesses the association between these ocular variables with behavioural performance during a continuous performance task. The accommodation and pupil dynamics (magnitude and variability) were objectively measured, using the WAM-5500 auto-refractor, during the execution of a {\~{}}14-min continuous performance task in a sample of twenty-three non-medicated children with ADHD and thirty-one controls of a similar age range.

However, no group-differences were observed for the other ocular indices. Both groups experienced changes in all ocular variables as a function of time-on-task. The variability of accommodation and pupil diameter were associated with several indicators of behavioural performance for the ADHD group. However, no bivariate correlations were found for the control group. The current outcomes suggest that the accommodation and pupil dynamics may be considered as potential predictors of behavioural performance, which could help to improve the robustness of ADHD diagnosis.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been commonly associated with alterations in visual perception. However, the individual behavior of visual perceptual skills and its relationship with different comorbidities remain unknown. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to examine whether visual perceptual skills are impaired in children with ADHD, as well as to test the possible mediating role of comorbidities. METHODS Thirty-five nonmedicated ADHD (20 pure and 15 with comorbidities) and 35 age-matched controls completed the performance-based Test of Visual Perceptual Skills. RESULTS The analysis between total ADHD and controls favored the alternative hypothesis (greater values for children with ADHD) for visual memory, spatial relationships, sequential memory, and all the composite measures (Bayes factor [BF] range, 4.26 to 366.85). The analysis between pure ADHD and controls showed that data are more likely under the alternative hypothesis for spatial relationships, sequential memory, overall, basic, and sequencing (BF range, 3.82 to 21.71), whereas the comparison between ADHD with comorbidities and controls additionally favored the alternative hypothesis for visual discrimination (BF = 5.37). Lastly, data from the comparison between pure ADHD and ADHD with comorbidities were insensitive for favoring the null or alternative hypotheses in any subtest or composite scaled score (BF range, 0.33 to 0.66). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that some specific patterns of visual perception are altered in ADHD, especially for the total ADHD group. The current findings also evidence that comorbidities play an important role in the association between ADHD and visual perceptual skills. Future studies should address the mediating role of each specific type of comorbidity.},

abstract = {Introduction Previous studies have shown links of body composition and fitness measures with brain structure, as well as with different aspects of emotional adjustment and well-being. However, the possible role of trait emotion-regulation success in the relationship between fitness/body composition and emotion-related subcortical structures has never been directly addressed. Methods Twenty-three elite helicopter pilots were assessed in fat mass percentage, an endurance test to volitional exhaustion, bench-press power output, and negative urgency (trait affect regulation failure). Their brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to estimate the size of the accumbens/amygdala, considered together, and the thalamus. Resulting correlations were used to test the relationship between body composition/fitness measures and brain structures' size, and the role of negative urgency therein, using structural equation modeling. Results Fat mass percentage was associated with the size of the thalamus and the amygdala/accumbens. In the latter case, negative urgency and bench-press power output predicted structure size (and explained the effect of fat mass percentage away). In other words, bench-press power output and emotion regulation success (but not endurance performance) were associated with a larger amygdala/accumbens size. Conclusions Bench-press power output and emotion regulation success are independently associated with a larger amygdala/accumbens size, although present evidence does not allow for determination of causal directionality.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this article is to investigate the acute effects of bench press sets leading to muscular failure with different loads on intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure. Study design: A randomized experimental study. Methods: Seventeen physically active young men performed four resistance training sets of bench press to muscular failure against different relative loads (65{\%} one-repetition maximum vs 75{\%} one-repetition maximum vs 85{\%} one-repetition maximum vs 95{\%} one-repetition maximum). Intraocular pressure was measured before and immediately after the execution of each of the four sets, and ocular perfusion pressure was also assessed before and after physical effort. Results: We found that intraocular pressure increased after reaching muscular failure (p {\textless} 0.001, ƞ²= 0.52), being also dependent on the interaction load × point of measure (p {\textless} 0.001, ƞ²= 0.33). Our data demonstrated that higher intraocular pressure increases were found when participants performed the bench press exercise against heavier loads, showing statistical significance for the 75{\%} one-repetition maximum (p = 0.020, d = –0.63, mean change = 0.9 mmHg), 85{\%} one-repetition maximum (p = 0.035, d = –0.56, mean change = 1.4 mmHg), and 95{\%} one-repetition maximum (p {\textless} 0.001, d = –1.36, mean change = 2.9 mmHg) relative loads. For its part, ocular perfusion pressure showed a reduction after exercise (p = 0.009, ƞ²= 0.35), being these changes independent on the load used. Conclusion: Bench press exercise leading to muscular failure provokes an acute intraocular pressure rise, with greater changes when heavier loads are used. Ocular perfusion pressure exhibited an acute reduction after exercise; however, its clinical relevance seems to be insignificant (lower to 4{\%}). We argue that the use of heavy loads, when training to muscular failure, should be discouraged in order to avoid acute intraocular pressure fluctuations. Future studies should corroborate the generalizability of these findings in glaucoma patients.},

Our results revealed that the text-background color combination modulates the accommodative and pupillary dynamics during a 2-minutes reading task.

Based on the relationship between the neural system that controls attention and ocular dynamics, the present study compares the magnitude and variability of accommodation between a group of non-medicated ADHD children and an age-matched control group. Methods: The magnitude and variability of the accommodative response were objectively measured in 36 children using the WAM-5500 autorefractometer for 90 consecutive seconds at three static viewing distances (500, 40, and 20 cm). Participants were divided into ADHD (n = 18) or control (n = 18) groups based on clinically validated criteria. Results: Children with ADHD exhibited higher lags of accommodation (p = 0.024), increasing at closer viewing distances, in comparison to the control group. Marginal statistical differences were found for the variability of accommodation (p = 0.066), with the ADHD group showing a trend towards higher variability. Our analysis showed that the magnitude and variability of accommodation did not vary over time between groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions: Our data suggest that children with ADHD have a less accurate accommodative response. These results provide a new ocular index that could help to clarify the relationship between accommodative response and attentional deficits, which could have a direct impact on the academic, cognitive, and visual performance of ADHD children.},

abstract = {Background: The deterioration of the integrity of binocular vision has a detrimental effect on fine visuomotor skills, however, its impact on sports performance remains unknown. We tested the influence of four viewing conditions (binocular viewing, monocular viewing, binocular viewing with monocular blur, and binocular viewing with binocular blur) on basketball free-throws performance. Methods: Twenty-three male basketball players (19.2 ± 3.4 years) performed 30 free-throws in each viewing condition following a randomised order. Image degradation was induced by the use of Bangerter filters. Complementarily, perceived levels of task load and complexity, as well as visual function were assessed. Results: We found a worse basketball free-throws performance (percentage of successful shots) in the monocular viewing (∼8{\%}) and binocular viewing with monocular blur (∼9{\%}) in comparison to the condition of binocular viewing (corrected p-values = 0.003 and 0.006; and ds = 0.838 and 0.771). The analyses of subjective ratings and visual function allowed us to confirm a successful experimental manipulation. Conclusions: Basketball free-throws performance is subject to the integrity of binocular vision, showing a worse accuracy when the sensory dominant eye was occluded or blurred in comparison to natural (binocular) viewing conditions. However, free-throws performance remains stable when the visual acuity is binocularly degraded. Our findings reveal that an appropriate functioning of the binocular vision is needed for optimal sports performance, and highlight the importance of a comprehensive clinical assessment or management of binocular vision in sport contexts.},

abstract = {Purpose: The present study aimed (1) to examine the impact of two high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols differing in exercise intensity (low intensity and high intensity) on the dynamic accommodative response (AR), and (2) to elucidate whether the ocular accommodation changes are associated with the function of the autonomic nervous system during stimulus processing, as measured by the heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: Twenty physically active university students (9 women; age = 23.9 ± 3.3 years) were tested on three separate sessions. The lag of accommodation and the root mean square of successive R-R interval differences (RMSSD) parameter of HRV were obtained at the beginning and at the end of each testing session, while one of the following protocols was applied in a randomized order between the measurements, low-intensity HIIT (8 sprints with 60 s of rest), high-intensity HIIT (8 sprints with 30 s of rest), and Control (walking for 8 min). Results: Our data demonstrated a higher lag of accommodation after the high-intensity HIIT compared to the low-intensity HIIT (p = 0.006, d = 0.798) and control (p = 0.007, d = 0.741), but no significant differences were observed between the low-intensity HIIT protocol and control condition (p = 0.598, d = 0.12). As expected, lower HRV values were observed with higher exercise intensity, but the changes of AR and HRV were not significantly correlated (p {\textgreater} 0.05 in all cases). Conclusions: The present findings indicate that the acute effects of exercise on ocular accommodation depend on exercise intensity, showing that highly demanding physical effort induces a greater lag of accommodation, which may be of relevance when performing near activities after physical efforts.},

abstract = {Background: Caffeine has a well-established effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP); however, the possible differences between low- and high-caffeine consumers remain unknown. Methods: In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, and balanced crossover study, 40 healthy individuals were divided in low- (n = 21) and high (n = 19)-caffeine consumers, according to their daily caffeine consumption. All participants ingested either caffeine (4 mg/kg) or placebo, and IOP and OPP were measured after 30, 60, and 90 min of ingesting caffeine or placebo. Subjective feelings of arousal were also obtained. Results: Caffeine induced an acute IOP rise (p {\textless} 0.001, ƞ p2 = 0.408), whereas habitual caffeine demonstrated a mediating effect on the IOP changes induced by caffeine intake, with high-caffeine consumers showing a less accentuated IOP rise in comparison to low-caffeine consumers. The greatest IOP change induced by caffeine intake was reached after 90 min from capsule ingestion, being more accentuated for the low-caffeine consumers (+ 3.4 mmHg) than for the high-caffeine consumers (+ 1.2 mmHg). Consequently, the participants reported higher levels of perceived arousal after ingesting caffeine in comparison to placebo (p = 0.002, ƞ p2 = 0.222); however, similar responses were given by high- and low-caffeine consumers (p = 0.256). Our data did not reveal any effect of caffeine consumption on OPP (p = 0.304). Conclusions: These results suggest that IOP responsiveness to caffeine ingestion is subject to tolerance, which could have important implication in the management of glaucoma. This finding may be due to alterations in the adenosine receptor system caused by chronic caffeine consumption. Future studies are needed to assess if these findings are also applicable to patients with glaucoma.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE Our data demonstrate that intraocular pressure (IOP) is sensitive to anxiety manipulation in sport scenarios, specifically in a basketball free throw task. The present outcomes may be of special relevance because of its practical advantages for the objective control of athletes' anxiety levels. PURPOSE Athletes experience high levels of anxiety during sport competition, and IOP has demonstrated to reflect autonomous nervous system changes during mentally demanding situations. We tested whether different levels of induced anxiety during basketball free throw shooting alter IOP. METHODS We followed a repeated-measures design to test the effects of anxiety-induced manipulation during basketball free throw shooting on IOP, shooting performance, and perceived anxiety. Eighteen amateur basketball players performed three experimental sessions consisting of 100 free throws each. However, we gave three different instructions to participants regarding the score assigned to each free throw, allowing us to manipulate the level of induced anxiety (low, medium, and high). RESULTS Confirming a successful anxiety manipulation, basketball players reported more perceived anxiety with higher levels of induced anxiety (P {\textless}.001, $\eta$ 2 = 0.37). Our data show that higher levels of induced anxiety provoke an acute IOP rise (P {\textless}.001, $\eta$ 2 = 0.44), with the low-, medium-, and high-Anxiety-induced conditions promoting an average IOP rise of 0.21, 1.63, and 18.46{\%}, respectively. Also, there was a linear IOP rise over time in the high-Anxiety-induced condition (r = 0.82). Nevertheless, we found no effect of anxiety-induced manipulation on basketball free throw performance (P =.93). CONCLUSIONS Intraocular pressure is sensitive to anxiety-induced manipulation during basketball free throw shooting, showing an increase in parallel with accumulated anxiety. Based on these findings, IOP may be considered a promising tool for the assessment of the level of anxiety in certain sport situations. Future studies are required to explore the generalizability of these results in other scenarios with different physical and mental demands.},

abstract = {Purpose: Assessing binocular accommodative facility (BAF) enables the evaluation of the interaction between the accommodative and vergence systems, which is relevant for the diagnosis of accommodative and binocular disorders. However, the tests used to assess BAF present methodological caveats (e.g., lack of objective control, vergence demands, and image size alterations), limiting its external validity. This study aimed to (i) develop a new objective method to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the BAF in free-viewing conditions, and explore its validity by the comparison with the Hart Chart test, and (ii) assess the inter-session reliability of the proposed method. Methods: 33 healthy young adults took part in this study. We used a binocular open-field autorefractor to continuously assess the magnitude of accommodative response during a 60-sec period, while participants repeatedly changed fixation from a far to a near chart when clarity of vision was achieved at each level. Accommodative response data were used to characterize the BAF measurement in quantitative (number of cycles) and qualitative terms (percentage of times that correctly accommodating or dis-accommodating in each level of accommodation as well as the magnitude of the accommodative change). Results: Our data revealed that the new proposed method accurately counted the number of cycles per minute when compared with the Hart Chart test (p =.23, ES = 0.02; mean difference = 0.18 ± 0.85). The inter-session reliability of the proposed method was demonstrated to be excellent (Pearson r and intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.95 to 0.98) for the parameters obtained with the BAF test. Conclusions: The present outcomes evidence that the proposed objective method allows to accurately assess the frequency and precision of BAF by the combination of the classical Hart Chart test and a binocular open-field autorefractometer. Our findings may be of relevance for the diagnosis and treatment of accommodative and binocular disorders.},

abstract = {Purpose: There is evidence that attention can modulate ocular dynamics, but its effects on accommodative dynamics have yet to be fully determined. We investigated the effects of manipulating the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, using two levels of dual-tasking (arithmetic task) and auditory feedback, on the accommodative dynamics at three different target distances (500, 40 and 20 cm). Methods: The magnitude and variability of the accommodative response were objectively measured in 20 healthy young adults using the Grand Seiko WAM-5500 autorefractor. In randomised order, participants fixated on a Maltese cross while 1) performing an arithmetic task with two levels of complexity (low and high mental load); 2) being provided with two levels of auditory feedback (low and high feedback); and 3) without performing any mental task or receiving feedback (control). Accommodative and pupil dynamics were monitored for 90 seconds during each of the 15 trials (5 experimental conditions x 3 target distances). Results: The lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state (p = 0.001), where a lower lag of accommodation was observed for the high feedback condition compared to the control (corrected p-value = 0.009). The imposition of mental load while fixating on a distant target led to a greater accommodative response (corrected p-value = 0.010), but no effects were found for the near targets. There was a main effect of the experimental manipulation on the accommodative variability (p {\textless} 0.001), with the use of auditory feedback improving the accuracy of the accommodative system. Conclusions: Our data show that accommodative dynamics is affected by varying the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, observing an improvement in accommodative stability and response with auditory feedback. These results highlight an association between attention and ocular dynamics and provide new insight into the control of accommodation.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine the intraocular pressure (IOP) changes caused by the execution of lower body and upper body resistance training exercises leading to muscular failure depending on the exercise phase (concentric vs. eccentric). We also assessed the influence of the exercise type (back squat vs. biceps curl) and level of effort on the IOP response. Methods: Nineteen physically active young adults performed four sets (2 exercise type × 2 exercise phase) of 10 repetitions leading to muscular failure while adopting a normal breathing pattern. IOP was measured by rebound tonometry at baseline, after each of the ten repetitions, and after 1 min of recovery. Results: There was a main effect of the exercise phase (p {\textless} 0.001, $\eta$2 = 0.56), observing greater IOP values in the eccentric condition of the back squat and concentric condition of the biceps curl. Also, greater IOP values were obtained for the back squat in comparison with the biceps curl (p {\textless} 0.001, $\eta$2 = 0.61), and IOP progressively increases with the level of accumulated effort (p {\textless} 0.001, $\eta$2 = 0.88; Pearson r = 0.97–0.98). Conclusions: IOP fluctuates during the different phases of the repetition in dynamic resistance training exercises, being greater IOP values observed during the more physically demanding phases of the exercise (eccentric phase of the back squat and concentric phase of the biceps curl). A heightened IOP response is positively associated with muscle size (back squat {\textgreater} biceps curl) and with the level of effort (number of accumulated repetitions). Based on these findings, highly demanding dynamic resistance training should be avoided when maintaining stable IOP levels is desirable.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: The use of blood flow restriction allows obtaining beneficial physical adaptions when combined with low-intensity exercise or even when used alone. We found that using blood flow restriction may be a potential strategy to avoid IOP and ocular perfusion pressure fluctuations provoked by strength and endurance training. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of bilateral blood flow restriction in the upper and lower body at two different intensities on IOP and ocular perfusion pressure, as well as the possible sex differences. METHODS: Twenty-eight physically active university students (14 men and 14 women) took part in the study, and blood flow restriction was bilaterally applied with two pressures in the legs and arms. There were five experimental conditions (control, legs-high, legs-low, arms-high, and arms-low). IOP was measured by rebound tonometry before, during (every 4 seconds), and immediately after blood flow restriction. Ocular perfusion pressure was measured before and after blood flow restriction. RESULTS: We found that only the arms-high condition promoted a statistically significant IOP rise when compared with the rest of the experimental conditions (all Bayes factors10, {\textgreater}100; effect sizes, 1.18, 1.06, 1.35, and 1.73 for the control, arms-low, legs-high, and legs-low conditions, respectively). For ocular perfusion pressure, there was strong evidence for the null hypothesis regarding the type of blood flow restriction (Bayes factor10, 0.012); however, men showed an ocular perfusion pressure reduction after blood flow restriction in the arms-high condition (Bayes factor10, 203.24; effect size, 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary evidence regarding the safety of blood flow restriction in terms of ocular health. Blood flow restriction may be considered as an alternative training strategy to reduce abrupt fluctuations in IOP and ocular perfusion pressure because its use permits a considerable reduction of exercise intensity.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by oculomotor abnormalities. However, the eye movement pattern of children with ADHD during reading has yet to be fully determined. This investigation provides novel insights into the altered eye movement pattern during oral reading of nonmedicated children with pure ADHD in comparison with age-matched controls. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to objectively compare the eye movement pattern during oral reading in a group of nonmedicated children with pure ADHD and an age-matched control group. METHODS: Forty-one children, 21 children with pure ADHD (9.3 ± 2.2 years, 15 boys) and 20 control children (9.3 ± 2.5 years, 10 boys), orally read a standardized text according to their age while the eye movement pattern was objectively recorded using the Visagraph Eye Movement recording system. RESULTS: The Bayesian statistical analyses revealed that children with ADHD exhibited a significantly higher number of fixations (Bayes factor 10 [BF10] = 3.39), regressions (BF10 = 9.97), saccades in return sweeps (BF10 = 4.63), and anomalies of fixations and regressions (BF10 = 3.66) compared with controls. In addition, children with ADHD significantly showed longer reading times (BF10 = 31.29), as well as lower reading rate (BF10 = 156.74) and grade-level equivalent (BF10 = 168.24) in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the nonmedicated children with pure ADHD have an altered eye movement pattern during oral reading when compared with controls, which cannot be attributable to any comorbid condition. The present outcomes may help to understand the link between ADHD and reading performance and design the most pertinent strategies to enhance the reading skills of this population.},

Background: We aimed to assess the effects of caffeine consumption before exercise on the IOP behaviour during low-intensity endurance exercise. Design: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced crossover study at the University of Granada. Participants: Eighteen physically active young adults (age = 23.3 ± 2.4 years) participated in this study. Methods: Participants performed 30 minutes of cycling at 10{\%} of maximal power production after 30 minutes of ingesting a capsule of caffeine ({\~{}}4 mg/kg) and placebo in two different days and following a double-blind procedure. Main Outcome Measure: IOP was measured at baseline (before caffeine/placebo ingestion), after 5 minutes of warm-up, during cycling (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 minutes) and recovery (5 and 10 minutes) by rebound tonometry. Results: There was a significant effect of caffeine consumption (P {\textless}.001, $\eta$2 = 0.50), showing that the ingestion of caffeine before exercise counteracted the IOP-lowering response to low-intensity endurance exercise. Greater IOP values at 12, 18, 24 and 30 minutes (corrected P-values{\textless}.05, ds = 0.90-1.08) of cycling were observed for the caffeine in comparison to the placebo condition. Conclusions and Relevance: The ingestion of caffeine ({\~{}}4 mg/kg) 30 minutes before performing low-intensity endurance exercise counteracts the IOP-lowering effect of low-intensity exercise. These results highlight that the ingestion of a considerable amount of caffeine before exercise should be discouraged for individuals who would benefit from the IOP reduction associated with low-intensity exercise (ie, glaucoma patients or those at risk).},

Materials and methods: Anterior segment biometry and intraocular pressure were assessed in 20 healthy young adults (22.2 ± 4.7 years) during the wearing of a drilled swimming goggle. The central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber volume, and anterior chamber angle, using the Pentacam rotating Scheimpflug camera (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and intraocular pressure, using a rebound tonometer, were obtained before, at 2, 3.5, and 5 min of wearing swimming goggle, just after removal, as well as after 5 min of recovery. Results: During swimming goggles wear, there was a significant corneal thinning (54.8 ± 41.1 µm, p {\textless}.001, ƞp2 = 0.532), iridocorneal angle reduction (2.6 ± 2.6 degrees, p {\textless}.001, ƞp2 = 0.241) and intraocular pressure elevation (4.0 ± 1.9 mmHg, p {\textless}.001, ƞp2 = 0.530). These changes returned to baseline values immediately after swimming goggle removal (corrected p-value {\textless}0.05 in all cases). No significant effects of swimming goggles use were observed for anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber volume. Conclusions: Wearing swimming goggles leads to acute corneal thinning, iridocorneal angle reduction, and intraocular pressure elevation. These findings may be of special relevance for individuals with corneal ectasias, as well as for individuals at high risk of glaucoma onset or progression.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the short-term effects of caffeine intake on the biomechanical properties of the cornea, as well as its possible association with the intraocular pressure (IOP), as measured by corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology (CorVis ST) in healthy subjects. Methods: Twenty-two low caffeine consumers ingested either a caffeine (4 mg/Kg) or placebo capsule in two separate sessions. IOP and corneal biomechanics parameters, including time, velocity, length, and deformation amplitude at the first applanation (A1T, A1V, A1L, and A1D, respectively); time, velocity, length, and deformation amplitude at the second applanation (A2T, A2V, A2L, and A2D, respectively); time at the highest concavity (HCT), radius curvature at the highest concavity (HCR), deformation amplitude at the highest concavity (HCDA), and peak distance (PD), were measured with the Corvis ST before and after 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min of caffeine/placebo intake. Results: Caffeine intake reduced the corneal deformability, inducing significant changes in A1T, A2V, A2T, HCDA, HCT, and PD (all p values {\textless} 0.05). Non-corrected and biomechanically corrected IOP values were higher after caffeine intake (p = 0.001 and 0.033, respectively). Also, the changes in IOP after caffeine intake were positively associated with A1T (r = 0.790 to 0.962), and negatively associated with A2T (r = − 0.230 to − 0.722) and PD (r = − 0.506 to − 0.644). Conclusions: Caffeine intake reduces the corneal deformability, with these changes being partially associated with the IOP rise. These findings evidence that exogenous factors such as caffeine intake should be taken into consideration when making clinical decisions that are based on the biomechanical properties of the cornea.},

abstract = {We assessed the mediating role of the breathing pattern adopted during isometric exercise on the intraocular pressure (IOP) response in the back squat and biceps curl exercises. Twenty physically active young adults performed sets of 1-minute isometric effort against a load corresponding to 80{\%} of the maximum load while adopting three different breathing patterns: (i) Constant breathing: 10 cycles consisting of 3 s of inhalation and 3 s of exhalation, (ii) 10-sec Valsalva: 3 cycles consisting of 10 s holding the breath and 10 s of normal breathing, and (iii) 25-sec Valsalva: 2 cycles consisting of 25 s of the Valsalva maneuver and 5 s of normal breathing. A rebound tonometer was used to semi-continuously assesses IOP during the six sets of 1-minute isometric effort (2 exercises × 3 breathing patterns). We found a progressive IOP rise during isometric effort (P {\textless} 0.001, $\mu$2p = 0.83), with these increases being greater when the breath was held longer (P {\textless} 0.001, $\mu$2p = 0.58; 25-sec Valsalva {\textgreater} 10-sec Valsalva = constant breathing). There was a trend towards higher IOP values for the back squat in comparison to the biceps curl, although these differences did not reach statistical significance for any breathing pattern (corrected P-value ≥ 0.146, d ≤ 0.69). These findings reveal that glaucoma patients or those at risk should avoid activities in which the breath is held, especially when combined with physical exercise modalities that also promote an increment in IOP values (e.g. isometric contractions).},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the acute effect of caffeine consumption on the accuracy and variability of accommodation, as well as its impact on pupil size and perceived levels of activation. Methods: 22 university students (21.68 ± 3.67 years old) ingested a capsule of caffeine (4 mg/kg) or placebo (300 mg of corn-starch) in two different days and counterbalanced order. After 30 min of capsule ingestion, we objectively measured the accuracy and variability of accommodation, and pupil size using the WAM-5500 binocular open-field autorefractometer for 2 min at each of the six viewing distances (5 m, 50 cm, 40 cm, 33 cm, 25 cm, and 20 cm). Subjective levels of activation to check the effectiveness of caffeine/placebo manipulation were also reported. Results: We found that after 30 min of caffeine/placebo ingestion, participant perceived higher levels of activation in the caffeine condition (p =.047, Cohen´s d = 0.48). Caffeine consumption induced a statistically significant dilator effect on pupil size (p =.011, $\eta$2 = 0.271), and reduced variability of accommodative response (p =.027, $\eta$2 = 0.211). However, no differences were obtained for the accuracy of accommodation (p =.321). Conclusions: Our data suggest that caffeine consumption reduced the variability of accommodative response and induced pupil dilation. Nevertheless, the accuracy of accommodation was insensitive to caffeine intake. These findings may be explained by the bidirectional relationship between ocular functioning and the nervous system´s state of activation.},

abstract = {A lack of exercise leads to being overweight or obese affecting regional brain structure and functional connectivity associated with impaired cognitive function and dementia. In recent decades, several studies of healthy individuals suggest that adiposity may also produce negative independent effects on the brain. We aimed to investigate the relationship between body composition – total fat mass (TFM) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) – with white matter (WM) integrity using a whole-brain approach in military pilots. Twenty-three military helicopter pilots (Mage = 36.79; SD = 8.00; MBMI = 25.48; SD = 2.49) took part in the study. Brain volumes were studied using diffusion tensor imaging technique by means of a 3T Magnetom Tim Trio. Measurements of body mass index (BMI), TFM and VAT were obtained using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The results showed that, on one hand, higher TFM was associated with higher white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and, on the other hand, higher VAT was associated with lower FA. Data showed that TFM and VAT are the critical factors underlying WM integrity in combat helicopter pilots. The authors suggest that fat presence enhance brain connectivity while there is no excess, specifically in VAT.},

abstract = {Caffeine is considered the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant (Rall, 1980), which acts on the central nervous system and certain portions of the autonomic nervous system (Barry et al., 2008). Caffeine increases cortical arousal by serving as an antagonist to the inhibitory neurotransmitter of adenosine A1 receptors (Ferr{\'{e}}, 2008). Also, it has proved to increase energy availability, decrease fatigue and sense of effort, increase alertness and concentration and enhance physical, motor and cognitive performance (Glade, 2010). Specifically, sustained attention (i.e., the capacity to respond to relevant stimuli and to effectively allocate attentional resources over prolonged periods of time), which is important in multiple cognitive abilities, living skills and responsible professional tasks (e.g. reading [Steinmayr, Ziegler, {\&} Tr{\"{a}}uble, 2010], driving [Larue, Rakotonirainy, {\&} Pettitt, 2011], performing surgery [Gawande, Zinner, Studdert, {\&} Brennan, 2003]), is highly improved after ingesting a single dose of caffeine (Foxe et al., 2012).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We compared the impact of a maximal treadmill test on intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure between trained and untrained individuals. METHODS: Based on the maximal aerobic capacity (relative VO2 max), 31 military helicopter pilots were divided into groups of trained (n = 16; VO2 max = 57.06 ± 1.66) and untrained (n = 15; VO2 max = 43.42 ± 1.19) individuals. Intraocular pressure and blood pressure were collected before effort, just after volitional exhaustion and after 5 and 15 min of recovery. RESULTS: The maximal treadmill test induced significant changes on intraocular pressure (p {\textless} 0.001, $\eta$2 = 0.52) and ocular perfusion pressure (p {\textless} 0.001, $\eta$2 = 0.60). Intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure increased just after volitional exhaustion (effect size = 0.88 and 1.59, respectively), and these values returned to baseline levels after 5 (effect size = 0.87 and 1.26, respectively) and 15 (effect size = 1.23 and 1.91, respectively) min of recovery. The untrained group exhibited higher intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure values in comparison with the trained group just after volitional exhaustion (effect size = 1.43 and 0.11 for intraocular pressure and effect size = 2.81 and 0.96 for ocular perfusion pressure). Five minutes of recovery was insufficient to reach baseline intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure values only for the untrained group (effect size = 0.91 and 0.72, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that fitness level modulates the intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure responses to a maximal treadmill test, being high fitness levels desirable in order to attenuate the impact of maximal efforts on these indices. These outcomes may be of clinical relevance for the management of glaucoma patients or those at risk, although future studies are needed to test these results in a clinical population.},

abstract = {This study aimed to test the effects of mental (i.e. executive) load during a dual physical-mental task on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), affective valence, and arousal. The protocol included two dual tasks with matched physical demands but different executive demands (2-back and oddball), carried out on different days. The procedure was run twice to assess the sensitivity and stability of RPE, valence and arousal across the two trials. Linear mixed-effects analyses showed less positive valence (-0.44 points on average in a 1-9 scale; Rbeta2 = 0.074 [CI90{\%}, 0.052-0.098]), and heightened arousal (+0.13 points on average in a 1-9 scale; Rbeta2 = 0.006 [CI90{\%}, 0.001-0.015]), for the high executive load condition, but showed no effect of mental load on RPE. Separated analyses for the two task trials yielded best-fitting models that were identical across trials for RPE and valence, but not for arousal. Model fitting was improved by assuming a 1-level autoregressive covariance structure for all analyses. In conclusion, executive load during a dual physical-mental task modulates the emotional response to effort, but not RPE. The autoregressive covariance suggests that people tend to anchor estimates on prior ones, which imposes certain limits on scales' usability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature Background: Surgeons' overload is one of the main causes of medical errors that might compromise patient safety. Due to the drawbacks of current options to monitor surgeons' load, new, sensitive, and objective indices of task (over)load need to be considered and tested. In non-health-care scenarios, intraocular pressure (IOP) has been proved to be an unbiased physiological index, sensitive to task complexity (one of the main variables related to overload), and time on task. In the present study, we assessed the effects of demanding and complex simulated surgical procedures on surgical and medical residents' IOP. Methods: Thirty-four surgical and medical residents and healthcare professionals took part in this study (the experimental group, N = 17, and the control group, N = 17, were matched for sex and age). The experimental group performed two simulated bronchoscopy procedures that differ in their levels of complexity. The control group mimicked the same hand-eye movements and posture of the experimental group to help control for the potential effects of time on task and re-measurement on IOP. We measured IOP before and after each procedure, surgical performance during procedures, and perceived task complexity. Results: IOP increased as consequence of performing the most complex procedure only in the experimental group. Consistently, residents performed worse and reported higher perceived task complexity for the more complex procedure. Conclusions: Our data show, for the first time, that IOP is sensitive to residents' task load, and it could be used as a new index to easily and rapidly assess task (over)load in healthcare scenarios. An arousal-based explanation is given to describe IOP variations due to task complexity. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SHAPE America Purpose: The purposes of this study were to (a) investigate the effect of physical effort (cycling for 60 min at 60 ± 5{\%} of individually computed reserve heart-rate capacity), combined with 2 different levels of cognitive demand (2-back, oddball), on intraocular pressure (IOP) and subjective judgments of perceived exertion (ratings of perceived exertion [RPE]), affect (Affective Valence subscale of the Self-Assessment Manikin [SAM] ), and mental workload (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]); and (b) ascertain whether baseline IOP, measured before exercise, is associated with individual differences in subjective assessments of effort and affective response during exercise. Method: Seventeen participants (M age = 23.28 ± 2.37 years) performed 2 physical/cognitive dual tasks, matched in physical demand but with different mental requirements (2-back, oddball). We assessed IOP before exercise, after 2 min of active recovery, and after 15 min of passive recovery, and we also collected RPE and SAM measures during the sessions (28 measurement points). We used NASA-TLX and cognitive performance as checks of the mental manipulation. Results: (a) Intraocular pressure increased after concomitant physical/mental effort, with the effect reaching statistical significance after the 2-back task (p = .002, d = 0.35) but not after the oddball condition (p = .092, d = 0.29). (b) Baseline IOP was associated with subjective sensitivity to effort and showed statistical significance for the oddball condition (p = .03, ƞ p 2 = .622) but not for the 2-back task (F {\textless} 1). Conclusions: Results suggest a relationship between IOP and physical/cognitive effort, which could have implications for the management of glaucoma. Additionally, a rapid measure of IOP could be used as a marker of individual effort sensitivity in applied settings.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC Purpose/Aim: The execution of strength exercises has demonstrated to increase the intraocular pressure (IOP) levels, and it may have a negative impact on the ocular health. We aimed to explore the influence of fitness level on the acute IOP response to strength exercises performed under different loading conditions, as well as to test whether the IOP responses differ between the bench press and jump squat when performed against the same relative loads. Materials and Methods: Forty military personnel males were divided in two subgroups (20 high-fit and 20 low-fit) based on their relative to body mass one-repetition maximum (1-RM). Participants performed an incremental loading test in the bench press and jump squat exercises, and IOP was assessed before and after each repetition by rebound tonometry. Results: IOP increased immediately after executing both exercises (p {\textless} 0.01 in both cases), being the magnitude of the IOP increment positively and linearly associated with the increment of the load in both groups (i.e., high-fit and low-fit) and in both exercises (R 2 range: 0.81–1.00). Higher fitness level attenuated the IOP rise produced by both exercises (p {\textless} 0.01 in both cases). The bench press induced higher IOP increments than the jump squat for both groups at relative loads of {\~{}}50{\%}1-RM and {\~{}}60{\%}1-RM (p {\textless} 0.01 in all cases). Conclusions: These data indicate that IOP increases as a consequence of performing strength exercises, being the increment accentuated with the increase of the load and in the bench press compared to the jump squat exercise. Of special importance would be that the IOP responses were significantly reduced in high-fit individuals. These findings should be addressed in glaucoma patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Perceptual processing is sensitive to physiological changes. Thus, the homeostatic disturbances during and after exercise may alter the visual function. Here, we investigated the effect of simultaneous physical effort and two levels of cognitive demand on skills related to the visuoperceptual and motor processing. METHODS: Eighteen male regular exercisers performed 60 minutes of simultaneous physical exercise (cycling at 60 +/- 5{\%} of reserve heart rate) and cognitive effort (mental workload). The same protocol was performed with a mental workload and an oddball condition of this task on different days in a counterbalanced manner. We assessed the near point of convergence, near stereoacuity, accommodative facility (Hart Charts), and eye-hand coordination before and after the two dual-tasking sessions. Also, we calculated cognitive-performance scores and subjective measures of mental load. RESULTS: We found that the near point of convergence (break and recovery) is significantly (P {\textless}/= .05) reduced after physical and mental effort independently of the mental level administered. Only the condition of mental workload with simultaneous constant-intensity cycling promoted a significant impairment in the near stereoacuity and the eye-hand coordination (P = .006 and P = .018, respectively); however, these two parameters did not significantly change under the oddball condition. The accommodative facility showed an improvement in the oddball and mental workload conditions (P {\textless} .001 and P = .006, respectively). Confirming a successful experimental manipulation, participants experienced higher mental demand and arousal and achieved lower scores on cognitive performance during the mental workload task (both P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: The visual function is affected by simultaneous physical and mental effort, the manipulation of mental-task complexity being an important modulator of this effect. Both dual tasks, physical with or without mental workload demands, may enhance or impair visual and motor processing depending on the visual parameter tested, and those changes could be related to the activation state of the nervous system.},

Fourteen participants performed three continuous 11-min blocks of a mental-workload task (3-back) and an oddball version of this task.

We found that {\{}IOP{\}} increased during heavy mental workloads (p {\textless} 0.01). Consistent with this finding, the autonomic control (HRV) and the cognitive performance were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.045, and p {\textless} 0.01, respectively), and the NASA-TLX scores were higher during the 3-back task (p {\textless} 0.01).

abstract = {Introduction: The prescription of blue-blocking (B-B) filters for the management of visual symptoms and signs associated with the use of electronic devices is routinely performed by eye care specialists. However, the utility of B-B filters is a matter of debate and discussion by the scientific community due to the lack of evidence supporting their use. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of using B-B filters on the dynamics of the accommodative response and pupil size and perceived levels of visual discomfort, while performing a 30-min reading task at a close distance in subjects who routinely use electronic devices. Methods: Nineteen healthy young adults (22.0 ± 2.7 years) read two 30-min passages on a computer screen placed at 50 cm, either while using a commercially available B-B filter or without any filter on two different days. The magnitude and variability of both the accommodative response and pupil size were dynamically measured for 60 s using the WAM-5500 open field autorefractometer at 4–5, 9–10, 14–15, 19–20, 24–25, and 29–30 min into the trial. The perceived levels of visual discomfort were also obtained. Results: The lag and variability of accommodation were insensitive to the blue light level (p = 0.34 and 0.62, respectively). There was a time-on-task effect for the variability of accommodation, showing greater instability over time regardless of the blue light level. The use of the B-B filter was associated with improved reading speed (p = 0.02), with an increase of 16.5 words per minute. However, it was not associated with any significant change in pupil dynamics or the perceived levels of visual discomfort (p{\textgreater} 0.05 in both cases). Conclusions: Our data showed that the use of a B-B filter had no effect on accommodative dynamics or visual symptomatology. Based on these findings, there is no support for the prescription of B-B filters to attenuate the visual symptoms and signs associated with the use of electronic devices in healthy young adults.},

abstract = {Aniseikonia has demonstrated to deteriorate the binocular function, however its impact on the accommodative response remains unknown. The present study aimed to analyze the effects of artificially-induced aniseikonia, using afocal magnifiers, on the dynamics of the accommodative response. The magnitude and variability of the accommodative response were objectively measured in 20 young healthy subjects by a binocular open-field autorefractometer. Participants observed a static stimulus for 90 s, under seven degrees of aniseikonia (0{\%}, 1{\%}, 3{\%}, 5{\%}, 8{\%}, 10{\%} and 12{\%}), and at three distances (500 cm, 40 cm and 20 cm). Complementarily, near stereoacuity, and perceived levels of fatigue and visual discomfort were assessed. The degree of induced aniseikonia was associated with the magnitude of the accommodative response (p {\textless} 0.001, $\eta$p2 = 0.329), obtaining a statistically significant reduced accommodative lag for the induced aniseikonia conditions of 8{\%}, 10{\%} and 12{\%} in comparison to the control condition at 40 cm (p-corrected = 0.019, {\textless}0.001 and 0.013, respectively) and at 20 cm (p-corrected {\textless} 0.001, {\textless}0.001 and 0.003, respectively). However, the degree of induced aniseikonia did not reveal any effect on the variability of accommodation (p {\textgreater} 0.05). We also found a decline in near stereoacuity and an increment of visual symptomatology when inducing aniseikonia (p {\textless} 0.05). Our data evidenced that greater degrees of induced aniseikonia cause a heightened accommodative response. These preliminary findings may be of relevance for patients undergoing cataract or refractive surgery procedures in which aniseikonia can be induced.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the mediating role of strength levels, hand dominance and participants´ sex on the intraocular pressure (IOP) behaviour during the execution of a maximal isometric handgrip test. Methods: One hundred and seventy-six sport science students (102 men and 74 women) performed a maximal isometric handgrip test with the dominant and non-dominant hands. A rebound tonometer was used to measure IOP before effort, during effort, and immediately after performing the handgrip test. Men and women were divided based on their handgrip strength in low- and high-strength groups using a median split analysis. Results: There was an acute IOP rise during effort, returning to baseline levels immediately after exercise cessation (P {\textless} .001, $\eta$p2 = 0.79). A greater increase in IOP during the execution of the handgrip test was observed for the dominant-hand compared to the non-dominant hand (P = .004, d = 0.30) and for men compared to women (P = .001, d = 0.90). The main effect of strength level did not reach statistical significance (P = .266). Conclusions: The IOP rise associated with a maximal isometric handgrip effort is affected by the participants´ sex (men {\textgreater} women) and hand dominance (dominant hand {\textgreater} non-dominant hand), but not on strength levels. These findings need to be corroborated in glaucoma patients.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: The performance of resistance exercise has evidenced to induce abrupt intraocular pressure (IOP) changes, which has been linked to the onset and progression of glaucoma. We found that four different isometric resistance exercises lead to an instantaneous and progressive IOP elevation, with these changes being independent of the type of exercise. PURPOSE: The impact of physical exercise on IOP has demonstrated to be dependent on exercise type and intesity, as well as individuals' characteristics. In this study, we aimed to explore the influence of the load, exercise type, and participant's sex on the IOP behavior during a 2-minute isometric effort. METHODS: Twenty-eight physically active collegiate students performed 2 minutes of isometric exercise in the military press, biceps curl, leg extension, and calf raise exercises against two different loads (high load and low load). Intraocular pressure was measured by rebound tonometry before, during (semicontinuos assessment [24 measurements]), and after 10 seconds of recovery in each of the eight (four exercises × two loads) conditions. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant effect of load (P {\textless} .001, np = 0.906), with greater IOP values when performing the isometric exercises against heavier loads. There was a positive IOP rise during the execution of isometric exercise in the high-load condition, returning to baseline levels after 10 seconds of passive recovery. The exercise type and participant's sex did not reveal statistically significant differences (P = .33 and P = .56, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data evidenced an instanteneous and progressive IOP rise during the execution of isometric exercise leading to muscular failure, regardless of the exercise type and participant's sex. After exercise, IOP rapidly retuned to baseline levels (within 10 seconds). The inclusion of glaucoma patients in future studies is guarranteed.},

abstract = {Abstract Driving is a task mainly reliant on the visual system. Most of the time, while driving, our eyes are constantly focusing and refocusing between the road and the dashboard or near and far traffic. Thus, prolonged driving time should produce visual fatigue. Here, for the first time, we investigated the effects of driving time, a common inducer of driver fatigue, on two ocular parameters: the accommodative response (AR) and the intraocular pressure (IOP). A pre/post-test design has been used to assess the impact of driving time on both indices. Twelve participants (out of 17 recruited) completed the study (5 women, 24.42 ± 2.84 years old). The participants were healthy and active drivers with no visual impairment or pathology. They drove for 2 h in a virtual driving environment. We assessed AR and IOP before and after the driving session, and also collected subjective measures of arousal and fatigue. We found that IOP and AR decreased (i.e., the accommodative lag increased) after the driving session (p = 0.03 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the nearest distances tested (20 cm, 25 cm, and 33 cm) induced the highest decreases in AR (corrected p-values {\textless} 0.05). Consistent with these findings, the subjective levels of arousal decreased and levels of fatigue increased after the driving session (all p-values {\textless} 0.001). These results represent an innovative step towards an objective, valid, and reliable assessment of fatigue-impaired driving based on visual fatigue signs.},
